# Team Finlytics Financial Metrics Testing ReadMe

The purpose of this tool is to provide financial analytics for a certain set of companies based on financial parameters like EBITDA, Total Revenue, debt-on-equity ratio, Diluted EPS, etc. Using these fields for the past 3 years we are trying to analyze if the company is in a good position to invest right now and how much return a person can anticipate for that company. 

## Problem Statement

- Lack of financial knowledge in people who want to invest their money in high-return stocks results in inefficient decision-making as they donâ€™t realize the risks and uncertainty associated with it.
- Difficulty in integrating the financial information available, with the financial news due to lack of accessible tools and guidance
- Complexity and inaccessibility of financial data can refrain people from entering the stock market and making informed decisions

2. **Bard Integration:** We integrated Bard to pull financial data for the same set of metrics.
3. **Data Comparison:** We compared the data extracted by Bard to the ground truth data.
4. **Analysis:** We conducted a detailed analysis of the discrepancies and inaccuracies in Bard's output.
5. **MakerSuite:** We built a data-tuning model for the selected companies to analyze the results and 

## Findings

Our preliminary findings indicate that Bard does not consistently provide accurate financial metrics. The discrepancies and inaccuracies found in the data extracted by Bard raise concerns about its reliability for financial analysis.
